# diabets_prediction_using_all_ml_models_andd_tensorflow

In this project, I worked to analyze the diabetes dataset and predict patients' diabetes status using classification models. In the first step, you examined the dataset and checked for missing values. The dataset included various characteristics such as gender, age, blood pressure, heart disease, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

Next, we used various graphs to visualize the dataset. m. Scatter plots showed how diabetes was distributed by gender, blood pressure, heart disease, and smoking history. I also created a histogram that shows the prevalence of diabetes by age.

I prepared the data to process the dataset with classification models. We used LabelEncoder to convert categorical variables to numeric values and then split the data into training and test sets. I implemented classification algorithms using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machines), LightGBM and TensorFlow to train the models.

Finally, I evaluated the performance of each model. We measured the success of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC score and MSE. These metrics helped me evaluate performance measures such as model accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, area under the ROC curve, and mean square error (MSE).
